# SeniorProject

The following project elaborates an application that has been developed to provide an user-friendly college Blackboard system. This system includes a Firestore database for the back-end to not only store user data but also to stores other sets of data. This application, as mentioned, is an efficient version of a college Blackboard system system with added functionalities such as classroom attendance, building check-in and check-out, evaluation form, and event calendar. Users will be able to log in to the application using their login credentials; in the event users do not have account with the application, they can create an account which will later have to verified by the user through a verification link sent to the user’s email. Every account is, by default, a student account which can later be changed to a professor or security account by an administrator or through a code that will be provided. There are four different views depending on the type of the user logging in to the application; the following are the views that are available: administrator, student, professor, and security. Each of these users have distinct permissions and viewing rights which will be further elaborated.
